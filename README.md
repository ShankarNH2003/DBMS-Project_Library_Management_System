<h1>Library Management System</h1>
<h4>The Library Management System (<i class="fa-solid fa-eye"></i>Tech library) is a comprehensive solution for managing library operations and resources. Designed with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), this project allows for efficient handling of book catalogs, user registrations, and borrowing transactions. It provides a user-friendly interface for both library staff and patrons to interact with the system.</h4>
